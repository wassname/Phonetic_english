Subject: RE: A Chrome browser extension that may make literacy a solved problem<br>
<br>
Thank you for sharing information on your innovative Phonetically Intuitive English (PIE) program, design to improve English language proficiency for stduents and adult learners. Your letter was referred to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education for review and I am pleased to respond.<br>
<br>
I have read your letter with interest and appreciate the thought and effort you have put into the PIE program. The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) supports the use of innovative programs to help all students achieve. However, the Department does not have the authority to determine the program of instruction, curriculum, disciplinary policy, or graduation requirements used in states and local schools. State departments of education and local educational agencies (LEAs) are responsible for making these decisions. Therefore, I recommend that you contact your local school district and make them aware of your program and its potential benefits you wish to make via recommendations and/or program improvements.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your commitment to public education. We wish you the best of successful with your future endeavors.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Janice D. Brooks<br>

Subject: National Education Association Expo - July 1-2 Atlanta, GA<br>
<br>
Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
I wanted to take a moment to see if it is possible you can exhibit at the National Education Association Exposition, being held here in culturally rich Atlanta July 1-2, this summer.<br>
<br>
Please visit our website and see if you can do this, or please give me someone I can call to exhibit your amazing new PIE schemes. I am the Sales Manager for the NEA Expo, and I read about you in the blog for the NEA.<br>
<br>
The demographic composition of the NEA's membership of 3 million educators and support personnel makes it an attractive target group for most marketers.<br>
<br>
Around 70% of the membership are married; the average age is 46. Women make up more than 70% of the group, and more than 80% have children. The average household income is $75,000, and two-thirds are homeowners.
Can you please contact me or let me know someone I can contact to see if they want to be in front of 15,000 educators, NEA members, delegates, and support professionals all in a two-day show. There will be more than 13,000 school districts represented, which according to what I have learned, will be governed by each individual state as to whether or not they can utilize this product in their school curriculum.<br>
<br>
I hope to hear from you soon! We only have one month to get ready! Can you please let me know if you can help?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
Jeanine Goforth<br>

PIE went there and got very positive feedback:<br><br>
<div class="text">
“There was a very positive response from the expo attendees with whom I spoke. I had laid out screenshots of the program in action and the consistent reaction I encountered was one of being impressed. People easily saw the application's usefulness and appreciated its ease of use. [...] The educators I spoke with were from all across the country. Some were teachers, others administrators, others retired. Those who were involved with ESL were quick to appreciate PIE's offering. I had several people tell me that they were very familiar with diacritics, but hadn't seen any that were as accessible as PIE's, and no one claimed to have seen a program of similar capability.”<br>

“I strongly believe that diacritics can and should be used to help people pronounce English when they are reading. I find this a very exciting concept; I learned how to read English using diacritics, and I have also found diacritics very helpful in languages I have studied such as Spanish, French, Russian, German, Polish, Japanese, and Latin.”<br>
