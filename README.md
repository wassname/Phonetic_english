# English respelling

This is a draft project to produce a chrome extension that will convert normal english into phonetic english, presented as Wikipedia respelling . E.g. pronunciation becomes [prə-nun-see-ay-shən](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pronunciation_respelling_key).

This can be done automatically as we can convert english to IPA (see the PIE plugins), then convert IPA to respelling. Why did I choose respelling? It's easy, close to english, and doesn't look unprofessional like other phonetic english schemes.

## Why do we need phonetic english?
English is a mix of old english and words from other languages. It's spelling is difficult that native speaker have competitions to see who is least wrong about spelling. Other languages have phonetic spellings, that is: you spell them like you say them. These language don't need spell checkers or spelling bees and the languages take less times to learn. 

## How will this help up move toward phonetic english?
Phonetic english would be better but we have had plenty of attempts to reform english spelling. American English is one example of this. However now we have computers that can automatically translate between English and Phoenetic English which removes that barriers to adoption. English learners can learn Phonetic English faster, with better spoken English, and still translate thier essay to normal English.
