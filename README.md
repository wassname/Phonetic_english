# English respelling

This is a draft project to produce a chrome extension that will convert normal english into phonetic english, presented as Wikipedia respelling . E.g. pronunciation becomes [prə-nun-see-ay-shən](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pronunciation_respelling_key).

This can be done automatically as we can convert english to IPA (see the PIE plugins), then convert IPA to respelling. Why did I choose respelling? It's easy, close to english, and doesn't look unprofessional like other phonetic english schemes.

## Why do we need phonetic english?
Unlike many other languages, English spelling has never been systematically updated. It is a mix of old english and words from other languages. It's spelling is difficult that native speaker have competitions to see who is least wrong about spelling. Other languages have phonetic spellings, that is: you spell them like you say them. These language don't need spell checkers or spelling bees and the languages take less times to learn. 

Spelling reform would make the language easier to learn, raise literacy levels, and save time, money and effort. It's Advocates range from Tennyson to Twain and we have had plenty of [attempts to reform english spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform). American English is one example of this. However these were slow and unorganised.

## How will this help up move toward phonetic english?
However now we have computers that can automatically translate between English and Phoenetic English which removes that barriers to adoption. English learners can learn Phonetic English faster, with better spoken English, and still translate thier essay to normal English.

## Why ResSpelling?
It's specifically aimed at english, not all languages like IPA. It's easy for English speakers to pick up and looks proffessional. Unlike other proposals which look uncomftorbly like txt speak or pidgin English.

## Examples

Here is a famous poem showing the irregularity of English spelling. [The Chaos](https://web.archive.org/web/20050415131319/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j17/caos.php).

```
Dearest creature in creation
Studying English pronunciation,
I will teach you in my verse
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse. 
I will keep you, Susy, busy,
Make your head with heat grow dizzy;
Tear in eye, your dress you'll tear;
Queer, fair seer, hear my prayer. 
Pray, console your loving poet,
Make my coat look new, dear, sew it! 10
Just compare heart, hear and heard,
Dies and diet, lord and word.
Sword and sward, retain and Britain
...
```

What does this look like in Phoenetic English?
